# Landing-page-with-Sara
This Landing page we are creating will be kind of revision before doing the  mini BootCamp project HTML CSS project from the microverse
we will do back this project

just for checking as I got "fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting" when trying to pull from git hub

so I used git pull --rebase 
          git pull origin <branch> --rebase
